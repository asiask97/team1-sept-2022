# Deployment

## Creating the Project
1. A new repository was created for the project on GitHub by clicking 'New Repository' on the GitHub user page, giving a name to the project.
1. The GitPod link created by the Chrome extension was clicked on the Code Institute Python template found [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template).
1. This created a virtual workspace which was then linked to my GitHub account.
1. After writing code for the project, I used git commands add, commit and push which sent all the project files from GitPod to my GitHub repository.

## Deploying to Heroku
The project was deployed on the Heroku site by using these steps:
1. Create a new account on Heroku.
1. Log into your account.
1. Click on the 'New' button and click 'Create New App'.
1. Choose a new name for your app, which must be globally unique to your app.
1. Select the Resources menu option from the top of the page.
1. Search in the Add-ons search box for Heroku Postgres.
1. Select the Heroku Postgres Add on from the results list and accept the hobby level tier.
1. Click on the settings tab and go to the hidden variables section.
1. Here you can add your SECRET_KEY variable which is hidden within the env.py in your Django project. It is a good idea to generate a new secret key rather than using the default one.
1. Make a note of the DATABASE_URL so that you can use it in your own env.py to connect directly to the Heroku databse during development.
1. You can also add a key for static storage such as Cloudinary or S3.
1. Click the Deploy tab in Heroku.
1. Connect your project to your Github Repository and select automatic deployment. This will deploy your project after every time you push your changes to Github.
1. For an e-commerce project such as this, you will need to use Stripe or another payment provider. 
1. Once you sign up with a payment provider, add their API keys to the secret variables section on Heroku and in your own env.py file.


## Local Deployment

#### Forking the repo on GitHub
1. Navigate to the Github page and log into your GitHub account.
1. Navigate to the project page
1. Click on the 'Fork' icon on the upper right hand side of the screen.
1. This makes a copy of the code in your own repo so you can examine it or open it in an IDE.
